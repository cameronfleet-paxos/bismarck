# Hello World - Getting Started with Bismarck

Welcome to Bismarck! This guide will help you get started with managing your Claude Code agents.

## What is Bismarck?

Bismarck is a desktop application that helps you manage multiple Claude Code agents from a single, unified dashboard. Think of it as mission control for your AI coding assistants.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Bismarck

The easiest way to get started is with the one-line installer:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cameronfleet-paxos/bismarck/main/install.sh | bash
```

### 2. Launch the App

After installation, open Bismarck from your Applications folder or run:

```bash
open ~/Applications/Bismarck.app
```

### 3. Add Your First Agent

1. Click the "Add Agent" button
2. Select a directory for your agent to work in
3. Give your agent a name
4. Start coding!

## What Can You Do?

- **Manage Multiple Agents**: Run several Claude Code agents simultaneously, each working on different projects
- **Monitor Progress**: See real-time status updates from all your agents in one place
- **Organize Workspaces**: Keep your coding projects organized and accessible
- **Stay in Control**: Start, stop, and monitor agents without juggling multiple terminal windows
