UI - Add nudge input to agent detail view (Eye modal or inline on running agent card).\n7.

{"id":"bismarck-6kc","title":"Add confirmation warning when reducing grid size","description":"## Problem\nWhen reducing grid size (e.g., 2x2 → 1x1), agents that exceed the new capacity are silently affected. Users should be warned and given a chance to cancel or confirm.\n\n## Expected Behavior\nWhen user selects a smaller grid size:\n1. Calculate how many agents will be affected per tab\n2. Show confirmation dialog explaining:\n   - Current grid: 2x2 (4 agents per tab)\n   - New grid: 1x1 (1 agent per tab)\n   - X agents will be stopped/redistributed\n3. Options: 'Cancel' or 'Confirm \u0026 Redistribute'\n\n## Implementation\n\n### 1. GeneralSettings.tsx - Add confirmation logic\nBefore calling `setPreferences({ gridSize: newSize })`:\n```typescript\nconst handleGridSizeChange = async (newSize: GridSize) =\u003e {\n  const currentMax = getGridConfig(preferences.gridSize).maxAgents\n  const newMax = getGridConfig(newSize).maxAgents\n  \n  if (newMax \u003c currentMax) {\n    // Count affected agents across all tabs\n    const affectedCount = calculateAffectedAgents(tabs, currentMax, newMax)\n    if (affectedCount \u003e 0) {\n      const confirmed = await showConfirmDialog({\n        title: 'Reduce Grid Size?',\n        message: `Changing from ${preferences.gridSize} to ${newSize} will affect ${affectedCount} agent(s). Only the first ${newMax} agent(s) per tab will be kept. Others will be stopped.`,\n        confirmText: 'Confirm \u0026 Stop Agents',\n        cancelText: 'Cancel'\n      })\n      if (\\!confirmed) return\n    }\n  }\n  \n  await window.electronAPI.setPreferences({ gridSize: newSize })\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Add confirmation dialog component or use existing pattern\n- Check if there's an existing confirmation dialog in the codebase\n- If not, create reusable ConfirmDialog component\n- Should support: title, message, confirmText, cancelText, destructive styling\n\n### 3. Backend handling (state-manager.ts)\nWhen grid size reduces, the state manager should:\n- Keep first N agents in each tab (where N = new maxAgents)\n- Stop/cleanup excess agents\n- Or move excess agents to overflow tabs\n\n## Files to Modify\n- src/renderer/components/settings/sections/GeneralSettings.tsx - confirmation logic\n- src/renderer/components/ - ConfirmDialog component (if needed)\n- src/main/state-manager.ts - handle agent redistribution on grid shrink\n- src/shared/grid-utils.ts - may need helper for affected count\n\n## Edge Cases\n- Tab has 4 agents, grid goes 2x2 → 1x1: 3 agents affected\n- Tab has 2 agents, grid goes 2x2 → 1x1: 1 agent affected\n- Tab has 1 agent, grid goes 2x2 → 1x1: 0 agents affected\n- Plan tabs may have different rules (unlimited?)","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"cfleet@paxos.com","created_at":"2026-02-04T23:33:47.707614Z","created_by":"Cameron","updated_at":"2026-02-05T15:53:04.2692Z","closed_at":"2026-02-05T15:53:04.2692Z","close_reason":"Closed"}

{"id":"bismarck-c78","title":"Clear focused agent when switching tabs to fix attention triggering","description":"## Problem\nWhen focused on a terminal in one tab and then switching to another tab:\n1. Focus remains on the agent from the previous tab (even though it's not visible)\n2. If that agent has a notification/needs attention, the attention indicator won't trigger\n3. User has to manually click on another agent to clear the stale focus\n\n## Expected Behavior\nWhen switching tabs:\n1. Clear the focused agent (set to none/null)\n2. If the previously focused agent has a pending notification, it should now trigger the attention indicator (yellow pulsing ring)\n3. User can then use Cmd+N to cycle to waiting agents\n\n## Root Cause (likely)\nTab switching logic doesn't call the focus clearing function. The attention system checks if an agent is focused before showing the attention indicator - if focused, it assumes user is already aware.\n\n## Implementation\nIn tab switching handler:\n```typescript\nconst handleTabSwitch = (newTabId: string) =\u003e {\n  // Clear focused agent when leaving current tab\n  setFocusedWorkspaceId(null)  // or equivalent\n  \n  // Switch to new tab\n  setActiveTabId(newTabId)\n  \n  // Attention system will now correctly evaluate waiting agents\n}\n```\n\n## Files to Modify\n- src/renderer/App.tsx or TabBar.tsx - tab switching logic\n- Check attention system logic to ensure it re-evaluates after focus clears\n\n## Testing\n1. Focus on an agent terminal in Tab A\n2. Have that agent waiting for input (would normally trigger attention)\n3. Switch to Tab B without clicking any agent\n4. Verify: attention indicator should now show for the agent in Tab A\n5.

Pick this up only on a fresh iteration with full context budget - don't attempt it mid-session.\n\n## Principles\n- **All tests must pass** - no flaky or broken tests. If a test can't be made reliable, don't add it.\n- **Readability first** - tests should read like documentation of what the app does. Prioritize clarity over cleverness.\n- **Happy paths only** - we're not testing every edge case.

Never spawn real Claude sessions. Tests must be safe to run repeatedly without burning tokens.\n\n## Core flows to test\n1. **Workspace view** - app loads, agents visible, can select/switch agents\n2. **Settings page** - navigate to settings, verify sections render, toggle a setting\n3. **Plan creation** - open plans panel, create a plan, verify it appears\n4. **Headless agent UI** - spawn a mock agent via /mock-agent, verify terminal renders, status updates show (all faked, no real Claude calls)\n5. **Keyboard shortcuts** - Cmd+K command palette opens/closes, Cmd+Shift+D dev console toggles\n\n## Implementation notes\n- Follow the pattern established in tutorial-test.js (test runner, timing, screenshots on failure)\n- Add new test files alongside tutorial-test.js in scripts/test/\n- Add npm scripts for running individual suites and all tests together\n- Use /setup-test-env to bypass onboarding before each suite\n- Use /mock-agent for any agent interaction tests - never real agent spawning","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"cfleet@paxos.com","created_at":"2026-02-06T00:59:23.881698Z","created_by":"Cameron","updated_at":"2026-02-06T02:18:01.945586Z","closed_at":"2026-02-06T02:18:01.945586Z","close_reason":"Closed"}

{"id":"bismarck-vcn","title":"Add 'Discuss: Headless Agent' command with auto-start","description":"## Overview\nAdd a new command that starts a discussion session focused on gathering requirements, then automatically spawns a standalone headless agent with the discussion output.\n\n## Key Differences from Plan Discussion\n- **No task creation focus** - purely requirement gathering and clarification\n- **Configurable max questions** - setting to limit discussion length (e.g., 5-10 questions)\n- **Auto-starts headless agent** - no manual step after discussion completes\n- **Discussion panel disappears** - seamless transition to headless agent\n\n## Implementation\n\n### 1. New Prompt Template (prompt-templates.ts)\nCreate `HEADLESS_DISCUSSION_PROMPT` that:\n- Focuses on requirements gathering, architecture decisions, edge cases\n- Does NOT mention task breakdown or beads\n- Has configurable `{{maxQuestions}}` placeholder\n- Writes output to a temp file when complete\n- Uses AskUserQuestion tool for structured Q\u0026A\n\n### 2. Command Registration (CommandSearch.tsx)\nAdd new command:\n```typescript\n{ id: 'start-headless-discussion', label: 'Discuss: Headless Agent', icon: MessageSquare }\n```\n\n### 3. Discussion Flow (new file or extend standalone-headless.ts)\n- `startHeadlessDiscussion(referenceAgentId, maxQuestions)`\n- Creates temporary discussion workspace\n- Injects headless discussion prompt\n- Watches for completion (output file written)\n- On completion: closes discussion, starts headless agent with output as context\n\n### 4. Settings (optional)\nAdd `headlessDiscussion.maxQuestions: number` to AppSettings (default: 7)\n\n### 5. UI Components\n- Reuse existing discussion terminal display\n- Add modal/dialog for max questions config before starting\n- Show transition indicator when switching to headless agent\n\n## Completion Detection\nSimilar to plan discussion - watch for output file write, then:\n1. Read discussion output\n2. Close discussion workspace\n3. Call `startStandaloneHeadlessAgent()` with discussion output prepended to prompt\n\n## Files to Modify\n- src/main/prompt-templates.ts - new prompt\n- src/renderer/components/CommandSearch.tsx - new command\n- src/main/standalone-headless.ts - discussion flow\n- src/main/main.ts - IPC handlers\n- src/main/preload.ts - expose API\n- src/main/settings-manager.ts - optional max questions setting","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"cfleet@paxos.com","created_at":"2026-02-04T23:25:18.20153Z","created_by":"Cameron","updated_at":"2026-02-05T16:31:36.523227Z","closed_at":"2026-02-05T16:31:36.523227Z","close_reason":"Closed"}
