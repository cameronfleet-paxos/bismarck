Show confirmation dialog explaining:\n   - Current grid: 2x2 (4 agents per tab)\n   - New grid: 1x1 (1 agent per tab)\n   - X agents will be stopped/redistributed\n3. Options: 'Cancel' or 'Confirm \u0026 Redistribute'\n\n## Implementation\n\n### 1. GeneralSettings.tsx - Add confirmation logic\nBefore calling `setPreferences({ gridSize: newSize })`:\n```typescript\nconst handleGridSizeChange = async (newSize: GridSize) =\u003e {\n  const currentMax = getGridConfig(preferences.gridSize).maxAgents\n  const newMax = getGridConfig(newSize).maxAgents\n  \n  if (newMax \u003c currentMax) {\n    // Count affected agents across all tabs\n    const affectedCount = calculateAffectedAgents(tabs, currentMax, newMax)\n    if (affectedCount \u003e 0) {\n      const confirmed = await showConfirmDialog({\n        title: 'Reduce Grid Size?',\n        message: `Changing from ${preferences.gridSize} to ${newSize} will affect ${affectedCount} agent(s).

Add confirmation dialog component or use existing pattern\n- Check if there's an existing confirmation dialog in the codebase\n- If not, create reusable ConfirmDialog component\n- Should support: title, message, confirmText, cancelText, destructive styling\n\n### 3. Backend handling (state-manager.ts)\nWhen grid size reduces, the state manager should:\n- Keep first N agents in each tab (where N = new maxAgents)\n- Stop/cleanup excess agents\n- Or move excess agents to overflow tabs\n\n## Files to Modify\n- src/renderer/components/settings/sections/GeneralSettings.tsx - confirmation logic\n- src/renderer/components/ - ConfirmDialog component (if needed)\n- src/main/state-manager.ts - handle agent redistribution on grid shrink\n- src/shared/grid-utils.ts - may need helper for affected count\n\n## Edge Cases\n- Tab has 4 agents, grid goes 2x2 → 1x1: 3 agents affected\n- Tab has 2 agents, grid goes 2x2 → 1x1: 1 agent affected\n- Tab has 1 agent, grid goes 2x2 → 1x1: 0 agents affected\n- Plan tabs may have different rules (unlimited?)","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"cfleet@paxos.com","created_at":"2026-02-04T23:33:47.707614Z","created_by":"Cameron","updated_at":"2026-02-05T15:53:04.2692Z","closed_at":"2026-02-05T15:53:04.2692Z","close_reason":"Closed"}
